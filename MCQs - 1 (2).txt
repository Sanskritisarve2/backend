verify(mock, times(2)).method(); verifies the method was called exactly two times.


You must initialize mocks with MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this) or use the 
Mockito JUnit extension.


It stubs the method so any call returns the specified value.


Itâ€™s used to capture arguments passed to mocked methods for assertions.












Both never() and verify(mock, never()).method(); are used to check the method was 
never invoked.



It auto-injects (via constructor/setters/fields) annotated @Mocks into the class 
under test.


Unused stubs are ignored by default unless strict stubbing is enabled.


















Methods annotated with @BeforeEach execute before every test case.


assertNotEquals checks values, assertNotSame checks reference identity.


assertThrows(Exception.class, ...) ensures the block throws the specified exception 
type.


Parameterized tests execute the same test method multiple times with different 
parameters.


@Disabled disables a test method or class.



Test lifecycle is per class, so one instance is shared across all test methods.


assertNull(object) asserts that the object is null.



git stash saves (and removes) uncommitted changes for later reuse.








git checkout -b branchname creates and switches to the new branch in a single step.



git merge feature brings changes from feature into main, combining the histories.


git fetch retrieves, git pull retrieves and merges into your local branch.



git remote -v lists all remotes and their URLs.

The command git remote -v lists all the remote repositories for your local repository 
along with their URLs. The -v stands for "verbose" and shows the fetch and push 
addresses for each remote.

origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)


git reset --hard HEAD resets all files to the most recent commit, 
discarding local changes.
